My first conversation with him was like speaking another language, just because his ideas and strategies that he successfully uses to help grow other people's businesses were so far outside my concept of what I thought I was supposed to do. James is incredibly intelligent, but also incredibly kind. He has a remarkable conviction that his ideas and strategies will help you be successful, and he is quick to be honest and say when he thinks something is not worth it. He has an incredible network of people that you get access to as well when you work with him. Lastly, he has a rare level of integrity that I have not encountered in any of the work I have experienced with other agencies. This is by far the longest running, most successful agency relationship that I have ever had.",

I have watched you sit with founders in the messy middle, the place where momentum slows, the offers sprawl, and the business starts drifting away from the person who built it. You do not add more. You remove the noise until the truth shows up. Your ability to simplify without shrinking someone's ambition is rare. It is not just strategy. It is stewardship. Anyone who gets to work with you walks away clearer, lighter, and more grounded in what actually matters.",

Somehow, after every call, I walked away feeling like Wonder Woman with a game plan, completely lit up, deeply grounded, and absolutely clear on what to do next.

He has a rare ability to cut through the noise, see the real issue underneath the surface, and articulate a path forward that feels both simple and powerful. What I admire most is that his work is not theoretical. It is grounded, honest, and rooted in real conversations that move people forward. If anyone is looking for someone who can help them sharpen their flagship offer, rebuild momentum, and lead with intention, James is the person you want in your corner.",

He helped us cut out the ideas that would not grow and focus all our energy on the ones that would. What really stood out was how he helped us with our funnel. Most businesses need a lot of lead generation and trust building first, but James helped us create such a strong offer that cold traffic started buying right away.",

                    <h2>I used to be the guy who needed to be the smartest person in the room.</h2>
                    <p>I built my first seven figure company by 26. I was sharp, driven, and convinced that my job was to have all the answers. I hired people I could direct, not people who could challenge me. And it worked—until it didn't.</p>
                    <p>In 2019, my body started shutting down. Over the next two years, I saw nearly 200 specialists, spent close to a million dollars, and heard more than one doctor tell me to get my affairs in order. I was on 96 medications. Some days I couldn't see. Some days I couldn't breathe. I had to step out of my business entirely.</p>
                    <p>Here's the thing nobody tells you: when you're forced to disappear from your own company, you find out real fast whether you built a business or just a job you couldn't quit. I got lucky. I'd already started replacing myself before I got sick. My COO kept things running. The business didn't skip a beat.</p>
                    <p>That experience changed everything about how I see leadership. I stopped needing to be the hero. I started listening more than talking. I learned that the best thing I can do for a founder isn't giving them more tactics—it's helping them see what they can't see from inside their own company: the self sabotaging patterns, the roles that aren't really filled, the team members they're protecting instead of leading.</p>
                    <p>Most of the work I'm proudest of—including projects with Tony Robbins, Peter Diamandis, Dean Graziosi, and the Dalai Lama—happened after I got healthy. Not because I was working more. I was working less than 10 hours a week. But I was finally working on the right things, with people I actually wanted to work with.</p>
